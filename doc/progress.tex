\section{Boids}

Boids is a simple simulation of flocking behaviour which mimics the appearance of a flock of birds~\cite{hartman2006autonomous}. It was first described by Craig Reynolds in 1987~\cite{reynolds1987flocks}.

Boids models the behaviour of a flock in as being effected by three primary steering forces: \textit{cohesion}, the tendency of an individual to stay close to the centre of the flock; \textit{separation}, the tendency of an individual to avoid collision with other individuals, and \textit{alignment}, the tendency of an individual to match velocities with its neighbors~\cite{hartman2006autonomous,reynolds1987flocks}. Each of these steering forces is modeled as a vector, which are then summed to compute the position of a given boid at each time interval.

The separation steering vector $\vec{s}_i$ for a given boid $b_i$ may be calculated as the negative sum of the position vector of $b_i$ and each visible boid $b_j$, using the following formula:

\[ \vec{s}_i = - \sum\limits_{\forall b_j \in V_i} (p_i - p_j) \]

where $V_i$ is the set of boids visible by $b_i$ (i.e. the neighborhood)~\cite{hartman2006autonomous}.

The cohesion steering vector $\vec{k}_i$ for a given boid $b_i$ may be calculated by finding the centre of density $c_i$ of the visible boids $V_i$ using the formula

\[ c_i = \sum\limits_{\forall b_j \in V_i} \frac{p_j}{m} \]

where $m$ is the cardinality of $V_i$. The steering vector may then be calculated by subtracting $b_i$'s position from $c_i$~\cite{hartman2006autonomous}:

\[ \vec{k}_i = c_i - p_i \]

Finally, the alignment steering vector $\vec{m}_i$ for a boid $b_i$ may be calculated by averaging the velocities of the set of visible boids $V_i$ using the following formula

\[ \vec{m}_i = \sum\limits_{\forall b_j \in V_i} \frac{\vec{v}_j}{m} \]

where $\vec{v}_j$ is the velocity of $b_j$. If the cardinality of $V_i$ is zero, then $\vec{v}_i = 0$~\cite{hartman2006autonomous}.


\section{Language Choice}

We chose Haskell as the implementation language for our Boids simulation.
Haskell is a purely functional language with lazy evaluation. It has been observed that Haskell supports the rapid prototyping of software systems, allowing working systems to be implemented quickly and with minimal complexity~\cite{hudak1994haskell}. This observation, along with our previous experience in the language, influenced our choice of Haskell as a platform for our project.

As our class experience with implementing Multi-Agent simulations has been solely through the object-oriented programming paradigm, our language choice presented a challenge, but also a valuable learning experience. Our
implementation of the Boid agents involves the definition of an abstract data
type, which contains the position, velocity, and neighborhood radius of an
individual boid. In Haskell, this is defined as follows:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
data Boid = Boid { position :: Point
                 , velocity :: Vector
                 , radius   :: Float
                 }
\end{minted}

Note that Haskell does not allow mutation of existing values. Therefore, once a
Boid is created, it cannot be mutated, and instead updating the Boidâ€™s state
requires the creation of an entirely new Boid instance.

Also, in contrast to a corresponding OOP implementation, which might define some Boid behaviour to accompany this basic data structure, this Boid data type is kept distinct from its update method. Instead, we define a type called \mintinline{haskell}|Update|:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
type Update = Boid -> Boid
\end{minted}

Thus, a function of type \mintinline{haskell}|Update| is a function that takes a \mintinline{haskell}|Boid| and returns
a new \mintinline{haskell}|Boid|. We use \mintinline{haskell}|Update| to define \mintinline{haskell}|Behaviour|:

\begin{minted}{haskell}
type Perception = [Boid]
type Behaviour = Perception -> Update
\end{minted}

This defines a \mintinline{haskell}|Behaviour| as a function that maps a \mintinline{haskell}|Boid|'s neighborhood to
an update function. These examples demonstrate how implementing a multi-agent
simulation in a purely-functional language requires a different conception of
what it means programmatically for an Agent to behave.
