# CS383 Final Project - Willem Yarbrough & Hawk Weisman

## Project Proposal

For the final project, we intend to investigate swarming and flocking behavior in multi-agent systems. Our project will consist of the implementation of a simulator for multi-agent swarming and flocking with a graphical user interface to depict the swarms being simulated. The simulator will be modular and extensible so that additional scenarios and behaviors may be added.

Once we have implemented the simulator, we will experiment with various behaviors and strategies. Some topics we would like to investigate using our tool include learning behavior, pattern-forming, and obstacle avoidance.

### Implementation
- Python? Or Scala? Or Haskell?
- Swarm simulation
- Agents have support for learning & pattern formation 
- Graphics frontend

### Experimentation
- Do science with our creation, somehow
